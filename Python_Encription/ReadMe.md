# ENCRYPTION is the procces of converting plain text into ciphertext

This conversion is done with a key called an encryption key...

DECRYPTION is the process of decoding of encoded data.  Converting the ciphertext into plain text. This process requires a key that we used for encryption.

The two main types of keys for encryption and decryption. They are Symmetric-key an Asymmetrik-key.

## Symmetryc-key Encrypton

In symmetric-key encryption data is encoded and decoded with the same key. This is the easiest way of encryption but also less secure.
The receiver needs the key for decryption so we neeed a safe way to transfer the key. Anyone with the key can read the data in the middle.
